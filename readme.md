# Prerequisites

1.  Download node https://nodejs.org/en/download/
1.  Open `terminal.app` and type `git --version`, which will either show a version or ask you to install. If it asks to install, follow.
1.  Verify both above installed by typing `node --version` (make sure it shows some kinda version). Then type `git --version` (make sure it shows some kinda version)

# Initial Instructions

1.  Open terminal.app 
1.  Go to your desktop, by going to `cd ~/Desktop`
1.  Clone this repo, by running `git clone https://github.com/GioLogist/limit-bot-playground.git`
1.  Go into the repo, `cd limit-bot-playground`
1.  Install "dependencies" (libraries that provide functions and shit your code needs), run `npm i`
1.  Open `finder` and go to Desktop > limit-bot-playground > index.js
1.  Edit the `shitYoureCheckingFor` variable, set it to w/e time is the next minute coming up
1.  Now run your script, run `node index.js` and you should see notifications telling you what's happening. It'll take 10 seconds and run every 10 seconds after
1.  **Optional** Download [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and open the `limit-bot-playground`. 

# Forever instructions

1. Open `terminal.app`
1. Go to this project/repo folder `cd ~/Desktop/limit-bot-playground`
1. **Optional** Update the code `git pull -r`
1. Run the script `node index.js`
1. Get creative, break it, edit all the variables, fuck it up. Put it back together. Worst case, just delete the folder and repeat initial instructions.
# Things to look out for

- Whenever running `node index.js`, make sure you're already in the repo folder (limit-bot-playground). You can ensure this by typing `cd ~/Desktop/limit-bot-playground` in terminal

- If you get an error, GOOGLE THE ERROR. That's half the battle
